# slowroll-autoyast

This AutoYaST file will install openSUSE Slowroll when used in addition with a openSUSE Tumblweed install. It will automate the installation process except for a couple of minor questions and at the end will leave you with a system that is running openSUSE Slowroll. This will be a terminal-only VM. When I have time, I will create a version for Gnome, KDE, and Mate. They will all have the same default username and password.

I suggest using the versions found in the stable directory for testing. These are the latest working versions of the files that I have created.

- Default Username used in this file: tux
- Default Password: linux
